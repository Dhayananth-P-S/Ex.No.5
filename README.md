## AIM:
To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts — **broad or unstructured (naïve prompts)** versus **basic, clear, and structured prompts (refined prompts)** — across multiple scenarios. The goal is to analyze the **quality, accuracy, and depth** of generated responses and understand the impact of prompt clarity.

---

## AI TOOLS REQUIRED:
- ChatGPT (GPT-4 / GPT-5)  
- Any other AI chatbot (optional, for cross-comparison)

---

## EXPLANATION:

### 1. Define the Two Prompt Types:
- **Naïve Prompt:** A vague, broad, or unstructured query with minimal context.  
- **Basic / Structured Prompt:** A refined query that includes **specific context, instructions, and constraints** to guide the AI model.

---

## PROCEDURE:

### Step 1: Select Scenarios
We chose 4 different scenarios:
1. Generating a creative story  
2. Answering a factual question  
3. Summarizing a concept  
4. Providing advice or recommendation  

---

### Step 2: Create Prompts for Each Scenario

| **Scenario** | **Naïve Prompt** | **Basic / Structured Prompt** |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **Creative Story Generation** | "Write a story." | "Write a 200-word fantasy story about a young inventor who discovers a hidden portal inside a factory, leading to a magical world. Include a twist ending." |
| **Factual Question** | "Tell me about AI." | "Explain Artificial Intelligence in 150 words, covering its definition, applications in daily life, and one challenge it faces." |
| **Concept Summarization** | "Summarize photosynthesis." | "Summarize photosynthesis in 3–4 lines, mentioning light energy, chlorophyll, and glucose production." |
| **Advice / Recommendation** | "Give me some study tips." | "Provide 5 scientifically proven study tips for engineering students to improve memory retention and focus before exams." |

---

### Step 3: Run Experiments with ChatGPT
Both naïve and basic prompts were tested. The responses were recorded.

---

## RESULTS & ANALYSIS:

| **Scenario** | **Naïve Prompt Response** | **Basic Prompt Response** | **Comparison (Quality, Accuracy, Depth)** |
|-------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Creative Story** | Generic story, very short, lacked detail and character development. | Detailed, structured, followed word count, had a twist ending. | **Basic prompt produced more engaging, complete, and contextually relevant story.** |
| **Factual Question** | Broad, generic answer, lacked clarity and examples. | Well-structured explanation, included definition, applications, and challenges. | **Basic prompt improved accuracy and completeness of response.** |
| **Concept Summarization** | Long explanation, included unnecessary details. | Concise and focused, mentioned required elements clearly. | **Basic prompt provided a precise, textbook-like summary.** |
| **Advice** | Gave random general advice, some irrelevant. | Focused on memory retention, provided actionable steps. | **Basic prompt improved relevance and usefulness.** |

---

### OBSERVATIONS:
- Naïve prompts often produced **generic, unfocused, and lengthy** responses.  
- Basic prompts consistently improved **clarity, relevance, and depth** of answers.  
- Certain simple queries (like definitions) still gave decent responses with naïve prompts, but refinement ensured higher precision.  
- Prompt refinement **saves time** by reducing the need for follow-up questions.

---

## CONCLUSION:
The experiment clearly shows that **well-structured prompts significantly improve AI output quality, accuracy, and depth.** Naïve prompts can work in simple scenarios, but for professional, academic, or creative tasks, **basic prompts are far more effective**.  

---

## RESULT:
Thus, the comparative analysis of naïve and basic prompting patterns was successfully executed and evaluated.
